# Project HYKLE üå≤

Hykle is a Next.js powered solution, primarily focused on to be a easy and accessible way to find competitive hiking, hiking routes, place to buy hiking equipment, find hiking buddies and etc.
This solution has been built from the ground up, with the framework Next.JS, along with using (database here) as external database for storing valuable data, users, text, images and so on! 

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE! This solution is purely built as a personal project, as a way to personally teach myself new techonlogies of web development, along with new understanding for React & Next, along with learning extra knowledge of working with external databases! ‚úÖ

The following are random details about what the project has to offer, or how even YOU can download and review it! ü§Ø

## Installation

To install the project locally, you can go ahead and clone the project down anywhere you'd like on your desktop. However it should be very clear, that you must add your OWN database enviromental variables (mainly because i don't want people to edit or delete my personal database data... üíÄ)

To run the project locally, you can do the following:
```bash
  Install and use node-version: 19.8.1
  npm run dev
```
